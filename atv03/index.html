            <h2>What is Old School RuneScape?</h2>
            <p>Old School RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), developed and
                published by
                Jagex. The game was released on 16 February 2013. When Old School RuneScape launched, it began as an
                August
                2007 version of the game RuneScape, which was highly popular prior to the launch of RuneScape 3. The
                game
                has since received engine improvements, new content, and quality of life updates largely decided by the
                community via in-game polls. Despite originally having a smaller development team and a slower update
                schedule relative to RuneScape, Old School RuneScape is now the more popular version of the game, with
                an
                all-time record of 231,719 concurrent players in December 2024. A mobile version for Android and iOS was
                released in October 2018.</p>
            <h2>About gameplay</h2>
            <p>Old School RuneScape is an MMORPG with adventure elements. It features a persistent world in which
                players can interact with each other and the environment. The basic mechanics are largely the same as
                RuneScape on 10 August 2007. The player controls a single (human) character and can interact with NPCs,
                objects, and entities in the game world by left-clicking or right-clicking and selecting an option from
                the object's right-click context menu. Users can gain experience points (XP) and level up individual
                skills, making their playable character more powerful in various ways.
                There is a large selection of skills, grouped mainly between three different categories: combat,
                gathering, and artisan. Combat skills, which are Attack, Strength, Defence, Ranged, Magic, Prayer, and
                Hitpoints, allow the player to defeat enemy monsters or other players in certain circumstances. The
                gathering skills, which include Mining, Fishing, and Woodcutting, allow the player to gather in game
                resources to use or sell. The artisan skills include skills such as Cooking, Crafting, Fletching and
                Smithing. The input mechanics are primarily point-and-click. The game runs on a tick-based system where
                the game state refreshes every 600 milliseconds.</p>
